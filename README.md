# Car-Rental
This project was my contribution to the Senior Showcase at FAU, working with a group of 6.

The project worked with XAML WPF with C#. My contribution consisted in creating a new Customer for the database

# Customer
The Customer creation for the database several fields needed to be correct.
The First and Last Name fields could not consist of numbers, these fields were prevented from using 
numbers.

Birthdate field was inputted manually or by using the calendar selector, and formatted to be inputted into 
the database with no issue.

Phone Number field was set so as you type numbers, letters and symbols could not be inputted, it would
be formatted as (XXX) XXX-XXXX

As the form was completed, it submitted it into the database and displayed it on the previous form.
